##Hospital Acquired Condition - National Measures
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hospital-acquired-condition-national-measures
Hospital Acquired Conditions - national data. These measures show certain injuries, infections, or other serious conditions that patients with Original Medicare got while they were in the hospital. These conditions, also known as hospital-acquired conditions (HACs), are usually very rare. If they ever occur, hospital staff should identify and correct the problems that caused them.

##Healthcare Associated Infections
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/healthcare-associated-infections
The Healthcare-Associated Infection (HAI) measures - provider data. These measures are developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collected through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). They provide information on infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital. These infections can be related to devices, such as central lines and urinary catheters, or spread from patient to patient after contact with an infected person or surface. Many healthcare associated infections can be prevented when the hospitals use CDC-recommended infection control steps.

##National Health Expenditures - Historical
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-health-expenditures-historical-4111e
The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) are the official estimates of total health care spending in the United States. Historical spending measures annual health spending in the U.S. by type of service delivered (hospital care, physician services, nursing home care, etc.) and source of funding for those services (private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket spending, etc.).

##National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC)—Wave 1 (2001–2002), and Wave 2 (2004–2005)
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-epidemiologic-survey-on-alcohol-and-related-conditions-nesarcwave-1-20012002-and-

National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) was designed to assess the prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) and their associated disabilities in the general population. The survey is the largest ever comorbidity study of multiple mental health disorders among U.S. adults, including alcohol and other substance use disorders, personality disorders, and anxiety and mood disorders. NESARC is designed to be a longitudinal survey with the first wave fielded in 2001–2002. The second wave of interviews was completed in 2004–2005 and used the same sample of respondents.

NESARC is a nationwide household survey with a probability sample representative of US adults. The final sample for Wave 1 was 43,093 respondents; Wave 2 was 34,653 of the Wave 1 respondents.
Data are not publicly available; however, researchers may request specific analyses via Census.

##Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to Combat Obesity, Heart Disease and Cancer
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-to-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer
Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and cancer are major components of the Community Health Data Initiative. This dataset provides key health indicators for local communities and encourages dialogue about actions that can be taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer). The CHSI report and dataset was designed not only for public health professionals but also for members of the community who are interested in the health of their community. The CHSI report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although CHSI presents indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer, it is imperative to understand that behavioral factors such as obesity, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially contribute to these deaths.

##Medicare Spending Per PAtient
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/medicare-spending-per-patient

##Hospital Compare
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hospital-compare-70539

The data provided includes process of care, mortality, and readmission quality measures. The collection period for the measures is generally 12 months. However, some measures may be based upon fewer than 12 months. Generally, the Hospital Compare quality measures are refreshed the third month of each quarter..
