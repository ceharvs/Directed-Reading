<h2>Kidney Transplant Process Model (KTPM)</h2>
<h3>By: Christine Harvey</h3>

<p>
The Kidney Transplant Process Model (KTPM) was built using data from the 
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Database.  This system was 
developed by UNOS and contains all OPTN data related to every organ donation 
and transplant event in America since 1987.  Statistics taken from this 
database as well as from OPTN reports were used to generate and then validate 
the model.  </p>
<p>
The purpose of the Kidney Transplant Process Model (KTPM) is to demonstrate 
and the kidney transplant process, from the initial waiting list to the 
post-transplant survival observations.  In particular, this model focuses 
on the effects of increased organ availability on the entire transplant 
process.  Thousands of Americans die every year waiting for a transplant.  
This model is a tool that can provide analysis for the effects of increased 
organ availability.  Increases in living and/or deceased donor transplants can 
be simulated and the resulting survival rated can then be analyzed.  This model
 includes a specific focus on patient age and ethnicity.</p>
